A friend came to Copenhagen once with a copy of Elizabeth Hardwick’s Sleepless Nights for me in her bag. Like gifts
she’d brought before, it was perfectly chosen. The intricate
prose kept me awake at night, puzzling out the point of view
and admiring the author. Hardwick wrote her novel late in
the 1970s, just after her divorce from Lowell, that poet prone
to telling it all. At the point Hardwick and Lowell divorced,
they had a teenage daughter, an apartment in Manhattan and
an impressive group of literary friends. Looking back at her
life from that vantage point, Hardwick describes in Sleepless
Nights some places she has been. At one point she offers a
succinct account of it all:
Tickets, migration, worries, property, debts, changes of
name and changes back once more: these came about
from reading many books. So, from Kentucky to New
York, to Boston, to Maine, to Europe, carried along on a
river of paragraphs and chapters, or blank verse, of little
books translated from the Polish, large books from the
Russian – all consumed in a sedentary sleeplessness.
This, she says, is the true though insufficient explanation
of her life. The books she’s read are coordinates, but they are
not a map. With reading as her mode of travel, she has been
a passenger without destination, a woman finding her way,
balancing her wishes against the grain of other narratives.
